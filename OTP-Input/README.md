# **Problem Requirements:**

Here’s what I usually come up with, keeping a 20-minute solution goal in mind:


1. **Core Functionality**: Configurable length, numeric-only, one character per field, auto-focus navigation, and backspace handling.
2. **Enhanced UX**: Paste support, auto-distribution, arrow key navigation, click-to-focus.
3. **Validation & Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard accessibility.
