## Problem Statement

Design an autocomplete UI component that allows users to enter a search term into a text box, a list of search results appear in a popup and the user can select a result.

Some real-life examples where you might have seen this component in action:

- Google's search bar on google.com where you see a list of primarily text-based suggestions.
- Facebook's search input where you see a list of rich results. The results can be friends, celebrities, groups, pages, etc.


## Note :
