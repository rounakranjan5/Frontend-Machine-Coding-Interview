# Tab Form Component

## Problem Statement :

I was tasked with designing a **form-based UI using React.js** in CodeSandbox.

The problem statement included three tabs: **Profile**, **Interest**, and **Settings**, each with specific field requirements such as:

- **Age Field**: Only numeric values allowed.
- **Email Field**: Validation to ensure the correct format.

I had to incorporate various input types, including **dropdowns**, **radio buttons**, and **checkboxes**. The form also needed:

- **Validation** for mandatory fields.
- **Data persistence** across tabs.
- A **Submit button** to submit the entire form at the last tab.

Make Sure to make it modular and scalable.
